The per acre use rate of BADGE SC is applicable for both diluent and concentrate spraying. Depending upon the equipment
used and the specific crop, the spray volume applied per acre will differ. Refer to Minimum Recommended Spray Volume Table.
Complete spray coverage is essential to ensure optimum performance from BADGE SC. When treating by aerial application or
with low volume application equipment, unless you have had specific previous experience, it is advisable to test for compatibility
and tolerance to crop injury prior to full scale commercial utilization.
Consult the BADGE SC label for specific rates and timing of application by crop. Where application rates and intervals are
provided in a range (e.g. 8 to 24 pints and 7 to 10 days), the higher rates and shorter spray intervals are recommended
when rainfall is heavy and/or disease pressure is high. Use the higher rates for large mature tree crops.
The pre harvest interval (PHI) for Badge SC is 0 days for all crops. Reentry into treated areas and harvest of treated crops can
be performed when wearing required PPE during the 24 hour REI for greenhouses and 48 hour REI for field applications","1","","http://Agrian.com","2014-03-19","","Grape Fungicide Entry Form (US)","Badge_SC_Label1ht.pdf","Badge_SC_MSDS.pdf","","4.30.36.70",

high water mark. Drift and runoff may be hazardous to aquatic organisms in neighboring areas. Do not contaminate water when disposing of
equipment washwater or rinsate.
Ground Water Advisory
Azoxystrobin and a degradate of azoxystrobin are known to leach through soil to ground water under certain conditions as a result of label
use. This chemical may leach into ground water if used in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow.
Surface Water Advisory
This product may impact surface water quality due to runoff of rain water. This is especially true for poorly draining soils and soils with shallow
ground water. This product is classified as having a high potential for reaching surface water via runoff for several months or more after
application. A level, well-maintained vegetative buffer strip between areas to which this product is applied and surface water features such as
ponds, streams, and springs will reduce the potential loading of azoxystrobin and a degradate of azoxystrobin from runoff water and sediment.
Runoff of this product will be reduced by avoiding applications when rainfall or irrigation is expected to occur within 48 hours.
Notify State and/or Federal authorities and Albaugh immediately if you observe any adverse environmental effects due to use of this product.
Physical or Chemical Hazards
Do not mix or allow coming into contact with oxidizing agent. Hazardous chemical reaction may occur.","1","","","2014-10-01","","Grape Fungicide Entry Form (US)","AzoxyStar1e_Label.pdf","AZOXYSTAR_MSDS1.pdf","","4.30.36.70",

and the grower are responsible for considering all these factors when making decisions. The following drift management requirements must be followed to avoid off-target drift movement from
aerial applications to agricultural field crops. These requirements do not apply to forestry applications, public health uses or to applications using dry formulations.
The distance of the outer most nozzles on the boom must not exceed 3/4 the length of the wingspan or rotor.
Nozzles must always point backward parallel with the air stream and never be pointed downwards more than 45 degrees.

DO NOT enter or allow worker entry into treated areas during the restricted-entry interval (REI) of 12 hours.
PPE required for early entry to treated areas that is permitted under the Worker Protection Standard and that involves contact with anything that has been
treated, such as plants, soil, or water, is: coveralls, chemical-resistant gloves made of any waterproof material, shoes plus socks, and protective eyewear.
Special Eye Irritation Provisions: This product is a severe eye irritant. Although the restricted-entry interval expires after 12 hours, for the next 6 1/2 days entry
is permitted only when the following safety measures are provided:
At least one container designed specifically for flushing eyes must be available in operating condition at the WPS-required decontamination site intended for
workers entering the treated area.
Workers must be informed, in a manner they can understand:
• that residues in the treated area may be highly irritating to their eyes;
• that they should take precautions, such as refraining from rubbing their eyes, to keep the residues out of their eyes;
• that if they do get residues in their eyes, they should immediately flush their eyes using the eyeflush container that is located at the decontamination site or
using other readily available clean water; and
• how to operate the eyeflush container.","1","","http://Agrian.com","2017-01-01","","Grape Fungicide Entry Form (US)","ArmorTech_CLT_720_FL_Label1.pdf","ArmorTech_CLT_720_FL_MSDS1.pdf","","4.30.36.70",

This cloud can move in unpredictable directions due to the light variable winds common during inversions. Temperature inversions are
characterized by increasing temperatures with altitude and are common on nights with limited cloud cover and light to no wind. They begin to form as the sun sets and often continue into the morning. Their presence can be indicated by ground fog; however, if fog is not present, inversions can also be identified by the movement of smoke from a ground source or an aircraft smoke generator. Smoke that layers and moves laterally in a concentrated cloud (under low wind conditions) indicates an inversion, while smoke that moves upward and rapidly dissipates indicates good vertical air mixing.
